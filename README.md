#Soundcloud Like List To CSV File
## Background
I use Soundcloud every day and over the time I have been using it I have accumulated 1500+ songs in my like list. As you can imagine trying to scroll through that list takes a long time. I tried looking for a programme that could do this for me but had no luck so I decided to try writing it myself. Although I am not new to programming, my code is still extremely messy 

##What This Programme Does
This program is made to take someoneâ€™s Soundcloud username and write their like list to a CSV file.

##Requirements
* Python 3 interpreter
* API key for Soundcloud, if you are logged in you can get one by clicking this link: http://soundcloud.com/you/apps/new
* Soundcloud Python Library, this can be found here: https://github.com/soundcloud/soundcloud-python 

##Further Development
I am currently working on this code, trying to make it cleaner and am hopefully going to be adding new features including a GUI.
